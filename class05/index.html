                <li>then you use the src tag, this tells the browser where to find the image. This should be a url.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>if the img is followed by a block level element (a paragraph) then the block level element will sit on a new line after the img.</li>
            <li>if the img is inside a block level element, any text or other inline elements will flow around the image</li>
            <li>align: left aligns the image to the left letting the text flow around the right hand side</li>
            <li>align: right aligns the image to the right letting the text flow around its left hand side</li>
            <li>top alighns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image, bottom aligns itin the center of the image and bottom aligns it at the bottom.</li>
