    <h1>Document Object Model</h1>
        <p>The DOM is niether part of html, nor part of the javascripy; it is a seperate set of rules.
            It is implented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas.</p>
            <blockquote>The Dom specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using the Dom Tree</i></blockquote>
            <blockquote>The Dom is called an object model becasue the model (the Dom Tree) is made of objects.
                each object represents a different part of the page loaded in the browser window.</blockquote>

    <h2>accessing and changing the html page</h2>
            <blockquote>The Dom also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.</blockquote>
    
    <h2>Access the elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>select an individual element node</li>
                <li>select multiple elemetns (nodelists)</li>
                <li>traversing between element nodes</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>work with those elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>access/update text nodes</li>
                <li>work with html content</li>
                <li>access or update that attribute value</li>
            </ul>
        <blockquote>Methods thta find elements in the dom tree are called dom queries. when you need to work with an element more than once, you should use a variable to store the result in this query</blockquote>
        <blockquote>when people talk about storing elements in varibales, they are really storing the location of the elements within the dom tree in a variable.
            the properties and methods of that elements node work on variable.</blockquote>
