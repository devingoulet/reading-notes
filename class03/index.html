    <h1>html</h1>
    <p>There are various list elements that can be applied in html that will have different effects on the page</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the ul element will provide you with a list in bullet point fashion</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>the ol element will provide you with ordered lists in a number fashion</li>
        </ol>
    <p>whenever you use an ol or ul element you have to nest the li element inside it, so the elements can work.</p>
    <p>the dl element is used for listng terms followed by their definitions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>dl element will usually have the dd or dt element nested inside it</li>
            <li>dd is the element used to contain the definition</li>
            <li>dt is the element used to contain the term being defined</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>boxes in html</h2>
        <p>There are several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes</p>
           <ul>
                <li>the way to specify the size of the box is to use pixels, percentages, or ems</li>
                <li>pixels are the most popular and allow designers to accuretely control the size</li>
                <li>Example: div {
                            height: 300px:
                            width: 400px:
                            background-color: lightskyblue ; }</li>
                <li>the example shown above will have to be done in CSS while linked to your html file</li>
           </ul>
           <ul>
               <li>every box has a border, it seperates one box from the other</li>
               <li>the margin sits outside the edge of the border you can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes</li>
               <li>padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. adding padding can increase the readability of its contents</li>
           </ul>
    <h3>border color</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>you canchange the border color by simply using this in your CSS p. one {
                                                                                        border-color: lightskyblue</li>

           </ul>
    <h4>decisions and loops</h4>
            <p>Loops check a condition. if it returns true, a code black will run.
               then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.
               it repeats until the condition returns false.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For loop: used to run code a specific number of times. in a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run</li>
                <li>While loop: used for when you dont know how many times the code should run. the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true</li>
                <li> example of a for loop: for (var i = 0; i < 10; 1 ++) {
                                                docmument.write(i);
                                            }</li>
            </ul>
