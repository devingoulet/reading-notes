    <h1>html has six levels of heading and many tags that do various things to the text</h1>
        <p>the heading levels go from h1 all the way to h6, obviously, with h1 being the main heading
        and each heading following that getting smaller and smaller.</p>
    <h2>The tags and elements</h2>
        <u>
            <li>A tag has to have an open tag and a closing tag, 
                the closing tag must have a forward slash following the left angle bracket.</li>
            <li>I couldnt possibly go all over all the tags, but my two favorite are the b and i tag 
                that perform the simple task of bold and italicizing. That is just a small example of what can be done.</li>
            <li>The tags and elements provide the semantic information of where emphasis should be placed,
                 the definitions of acronyms used, as well as when text is in a quotation.</li>

    <h3>CSS or Cascading style sheets</h3>
        <p>To simplify what CSS does, it is a design tool that allows you to modify your html document.
            You can edit the text font and the color, the background of the webpage, decide where the text appears on the screen
            so on and so forth. The key to mastering css is by first understanding the basic properties and then learning how to apply them properly.
            The most important thing is practice.</p>
        <p>One thing I have had trouble with is the linking of your html and CSS. To do that you have to have an href, the type, and the rel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>href: specifies the path to the css file example: href="css/styles.css"</li>
                <li>type: this specifies the type of document being linked to. the value should be text/css example: type="text/css"</li>
                <li>rel: specifies the relationship between the html page and the file it is linked to. value is stylesheet when linked to css 
                    example: rel="stylesheet"</li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Javascript</h4>
        <p>A script is a series of instructiosn that the computer can follow one-by-one. 
            Each instruction is a statement and the should all end in a semicolon.</p>
        <p>You must keep javascript code in its own file. javascript files are text files, but they have to have .js extenesion</p>
        <p>comparison operations and evaluating conditions</p>
        <p>you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
            the result will be a boolean: true or false.</p>
        <p>Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of 
            more than one comparison operatiors for example using and "&&" or the or "||" also the not which is "!"</p>
