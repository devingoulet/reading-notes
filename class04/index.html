    <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>Links are the defining feature of the web becasue they allow you to move from 
            one web page to another - thus the term surfing the web.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Links are created using the a element, you specidy which page you want to link to using the href attribute</li>
            <li>The text between the opening and close a tag is known as the link text</li>
            <li>the link text should explain where the visitors will be taken if they click the link</li>
            <li>when you link to a different website the value of the href attribute will be the full web address of the site, known as the absolute URL</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Layouts</h1>
        <p>CSS treats each html elements as if it is in its own box. This box will either
            be a block-level box or an inline box</p>
        <h2>Block-level elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>they start on a new line examples: h1, p, ul, li</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Inline elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>flow in between surrounding text examples: img, b, i</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>containing elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>if one block-level element sits inside another block-level then the outer</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>positioning schemes</h2>
            <p>positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.
                you specify the positioning scheme using the position property in css. You can also float elements using the float property</p>
            <ul>
                <li>normal flow: specifying the width of the boxes they will not appear next to eachother becuase this is their default behavior.</li>
                <li>relative positioning: this moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top,right,bottom, or left of where it wouold have been placed. this does not effect the position of the surrounding elements</li>
                <li>absolute positioning: this positions the element in relation to its containing element. it is taken out of the normal flow, meaning that it doesnt effect the position of any surrounding elements.</li>
                <li>fixed positiong: this is a form of absolute positioning that positions the elements in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element.</li>
                <li>floating elements: an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Javascript Functions</h1>
            <p>functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
                specific tasl. if different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function</p>

            <p>some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. Example, a function to calculate
                the are of a box would need to know its height and width. Pieces of info that are passed through functions are called parameters.</p>
            
            <p>These statements update the message at the top of the page. The function acts like a store; it holds the statements that are contained 
                in the curly braces until you are ready to use them. Those statements are nut run until the function is called.</p>

            <p>To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. 
                This is the function declaration.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>you declare a function, using the function keyword</li>
                    <li>you give the function a name/identifier</li>
                    <li>the statement that preforms the task will be inside curly braces</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>if a function needs specific information to run, when its declared you give the function parameters</li>
                    <li>if a function needs info you indicate what it needs to know inside parantheses, those items inside are the parameters</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Getting values out of functions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>some functions return info to the code that called them, when performing a calculation theyll return the result</li>
                    <li>functions can return more than one value when using an array</li>
                </ul>
