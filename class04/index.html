    <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>Links are the defining feature of the web becasue they allow you to move from 
            one web page to another - thus the term surfing the web.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Links are created using the a element, you specidy which page you want to link to using the href attribute</li>
            <li>The text between the opening and close a tag is known as the link text</li>
            <li>the link text should explain where the visitors will be taken if they click the link</li>
            <li>when you link to a different website the value of the href attribute will be the full web address of the site, known as the absolute URL</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Layouts</h1>
        <p>CSS treats each html elements as if it is in its own box. This box will either
            be a block-level box or an inline box</p>
        <h2>Block-level elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>they start on a new line examples: h1, p, ul, li</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Inline elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>flow in between surrounding text examples: img, b, i</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>containing elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>if one block-level element sits inside another block-level then the outer</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>positioning schemes</h2>
            <p>positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.
                you specify the positioning scheme using the position property in css. You can also float elements using the float property</p>
            <ul>
                <li>normal flow: specifying the width of the boxes they will not appear next to eachother becuase this is their default behavior.</li>
                <li>relative positioning: this moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top,right,bottom, or left of where it wouold have been placed. this does not effect the position of the surrounding elements</li>
                <li>absolute positioning: this positions the element in relation to its containing element. it is taken out of the normal flow, meaning that it doesnt effect the position of any surrounding elements.</li>
                <li>fixed positiong: this is a form of absolute positioning that positions the elements in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element.</li>
                <li>floating elements: an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.</li>
            </ul>
